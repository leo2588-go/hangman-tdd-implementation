# Hangman Game - TDD Implementation

A console-based Hangman word guessing game built using Test-Driven Development principles for PRT582 Software Unit Testing coursework at Charles Darwin University.

## About This Project

This project demonstrates practical application of Test-Driven Development (TDD) through implementation of a classic word game. The code follows the red-green-refactor cycle throughout development and includes comprehensive automated testing.

**Key Features:**
- Two difficulty levels (basic words vs phrases)
- Real-time 15-second timer for each guess
- Comprehensive input validation and error handling
- Modular architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Full test coverage with 40+ unit tests

## Quick Start

**Requirements:**
- Python 3.7 or newer
- No external dependencies (uses only standard library)

**To play the game:**
```bash
python hangman.py
